-- You can add your own plugins here or in other files in this directory!
--  I promise not to create any merge conflicts in this directory :)

return {
	-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded:
	--  config = function() ... end

	-- For additional information with loading, sourcing and examples see `:help lazy.nvim-ðŸ”Œ-plugin-spec`
	-- Or use telescope!
	-- In normal mode type `<space>sh` then write `lazy.nvim-plugin`
	-- you can continue same window with `<space>sr` which resumes last telescope search
